# Concert manager project

## Project Description
Our project is an application that will help with event management. Our application specifically manages venues that hold concerts and orchestras. Our application also tracks tickets and show members associated with them, as well as performance recordings and stage crew members

## Project Timeline

### Step 1: INITIALIZATIONS (Nov 4)
SQL script to create all the tables and data in the database
- from Milestone 2 (correct any mistakes mentioned by the TA)
- write create tables and inserts to test out the tables

### Step 2: CREATE TESTS (Nov 8)
Write tests for Audience, Performers, Managers, Videographers
- Aaron: Performers
- Tony: Managers
- Hannah: Audience & Videographers
- <em> Each person will be in charge for each throughout the entire schedule </em>

### Step 3: BACK-END (Nov 17)
Create function for each functionality:
- <strong>Audience</strong>: Create an account, Search through performances, Purchase tickets (updating the foreign key on the tickets) 
- <strong>Performers</strong>: Create an account - identify themselves, Create a performance - identify the types of performance, Search through venues, Create tickets for the performance
- <strong>Managers</strong>: Create an account, Select their venue, See their stage crew members, See a list of all managers, Create a stage crew member account, Move the stage crew members to other managers, Delete stage crew members

### Step 4: TESTING (Nov 18)
Make sure all functions pass according to the tests

### Step 5: FRONT-END (Nov 22)
Create a simple GUI that allows each functionality to be accessed by the users.
1. Frontpage identifying whether you are an show, performer, manager, or videographer (<em>By Tony</em>)
2. Then each page created for show, performer, manager, and videographer 

### Step 6: CONNECT BACK-END & FRONT-END (Nov 25)
